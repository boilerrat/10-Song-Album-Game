**The Legendary 10 Song Album Game**

---

**1. Playlist Length and Contributions**

- Each playlist consists of **10 songs**.
- **One contribution per user per playlist, unless game idles for 24 hours, anyone may add another song to the album.**

**2. Eligible Songs**

- Songs must be available on streaming platforms (e.g., YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, Genesis).

**3. Themes**

- Each playlist is built around a specific **theme** set at the beginning.
- The user who adds the **10th song** (completes the playlist) gets to **choose and start** the next theme.
- Previous themes may be repeated, but previous playlists must be referenced to ensure **no song duplication** between volumes.

**4. Adding Your Song**

- **Check the latest version** of the playlist to avoid overlapping with someone else's contribution.
- Copy the current playlist, add your song in the correct track number slot, and repost the updated playlist in the thread.
- **Provide the following details**:
  - **Track Number** (1-10)
  - **Artist Name**
  - **Song Title**
  - **Link to the Song** (preferably YouTube for accessibility)

**Posting Format Example:**

```
Track 3 > Artist: Radiohead > Song: "Karma Police" > [YouTube Link]
```

**5. Clarifying Themes**

- The user who sets the theme should **clarify any ambiguities** and answer questions.
- Themes can be broad or specific (e.g., "Songs about the ocean," "90's Hip-Hop," "Songs with a color in the title").

**6. Numbering Playlists**

- **Number each playlist** sequentially (e.g., "Playlist #5: Songs About Space") to keep track.

**7. Community Etiquette**

- Be respectful of others' contributions and theme guidelines.
- Encourage diversity in song selections to create a **rich and varied playlist**.

**8. Playlist Compilation**

- Once a playlist is complete, a community member can **compile the songs into a shared playlist** on a streaming platform for everyone to enjoy.
- Ensure all songs are available on the chosen platform before compiling.

**9. Accessibility**

- When possible, choose songs and links that are accessible to the majority of the community, avoiding **region-locked content**.

**10. Optional Enhancements**

- **Interactive Discussions**: Feel free to discuss why you chose a particular song or what it means to you.
- **Collaborative Artwork**: Members can contribute artwork for the playlist cover if desired.
